# Game-Development-Project

# What this is:
This is the game development project created by my team and me in our Game art and Assets course taken as a graduate level course in the University of Houston.  The project is a culmination of a semester's worth of work, ending in a final 'release' that was judged by computer industry experts in Houston.  Our team earned the highest score and thus the highest grade for our project.

### Documents Folder:
This folder contains various documents used in development of the game. the Llamas GDD is our game design document that discusses the game, how it was to operate, the assets to create fore the game and how they were to work. This was our primary guide to developing the game.

The level design folder contains images that were used in designing the levels of the game. The tutorial, crew quarters and boss level were designed as is.  The warehouse level was slightly altered but still maintained the basic overall design that was intended for it. 

### Unity Files Folder:
This folder contains all of the data needed to open the project in Unity and look through the various scripts and scenes used(or in the end not used) in the development of this game.  The README.md folder will discuss how to succesfully download this section for replication.
