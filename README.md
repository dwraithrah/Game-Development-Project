# Game-Development-Project

# What this is:
This is the game development project created by my team and me in our Game art and Assets course taken as a graduate level course in the University of Houston.  The project is a culmination of a semester's worth of work, ending in a final 'release' that was judged by computer industry experts in Houston.  Our team earned the highest score and thus the highest grade for our project.
