## Step 1: Download Content
Download all of the content in this folder into a separate folder on your computer. 

## Step 2: Unzip zipped folders
There are three zipped folders. Assets.zip and Library.zip, and RobertJacksonScripts.zip. Unzip them in the folder you have created for all of the documents. Ensure they go ito their own folders named, respectively, Assets and Library. The RobertJacksonScripts.zip are merely the scripts I specifically wrote for the game copied into its own folder for easier access and reading. They can be read by Microsoft Visual studio, wordpad and note pad.  

## Step3: Open project with Unity
Open  Unity then navigate to the folder you have created. Unity should detect and and you should be able to open the project as is. It will take a moment but you should be able to see all of the assetts through Unity. 

# Scripts:

If you're interested in looking at the scripts, they will be located in Assets/Scripts of Assets/Tile Engine/Scripts. They were written in C# using Visual studio 2015, Unity, or notepad.
